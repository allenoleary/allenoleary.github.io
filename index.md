### The White Queen - play script

My play, 'The White Queen', now ready for reading and further workshops and placement in theatres.

### This site now live

Moved form a wordpress blog that wan't giving me any value to new lo-fi site made with Jekyll. I have added a lot of archive material here, including some digital works from last century and a lot of advice articles on writing.

### Newsletter

I have a very occasional newsletter that goes to not many people; once or twice a year I post to it to announce something big - like a new play, work of non-fiction or sequence of poems. 

Day by day I tend to pop stuff on Instagram: [@allenoleary](https://www.instagram.com/allenoleary/)
