<h2 id="from-the-reviews">From the reviews</h2>

<p>“Bravo to Allen O’Leary for telling a bitter truth about wartime New Zealand, and doing so with such insight and compassion.” – Sunday Star Times</p>

<p>“Fond Love and Kisses is a multi-faceted drama that comprehensively takes its central characters through confrontation, crisis and catharsis… a consummate work of theatre art that demands you ask questions of it. And the more you think the answers through, the more it rewards you…. Anyone who has grown up in New Zealand will have someone in the family or a neighbour, teacher or colleague who was directly affected by what the play covers. Both times I saw it, the audience was riveted, appreciative and still engaged beyond its short two-hour running time.” – National Business Review</p>

<p>Full credit must go to O’Leary for his well researched play, which encompasses divergent locations of ‘war is hell’ on the front lines and the difficult domestic environment which the soldiers encountered… Absorbing and honest throughout, this was a play of soaring emotions.” – Capital Times</p>
