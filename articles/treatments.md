title: Should I *always* write a treatment then?

year: 2004

<p>You could spend hours online reading about whether is was a good idea to write a treatment or outline before you begin to write a script. They are often good threads to read, but I get frustrated when you start seeing words like  'always' and 'never'; always write a treatment, always do this and so on. So here's what I think abut the topic...</p>
## Everyone is wrong, it's only you that needs to be right

<p>It's over to you. That sounds trite but there's a deeper level to look at here; every process will tend to produce a similar product. By that I mean if you write a film straight after reading anything by a contemporary script guru it will tend to read like a version of their process. If you decide that you want to 'go auteur' and follow the method of Auteur X, then your next work is going to look like it.</p>

## Get your own damn process

<p>So if you want to produce exceptional, non derivative, unique stories for the screen you had better have a non derivative and unique process that is entirely yours. And I don't mean whether you use a lined pad or a 3x5 card I mean the really hard stuff where you figure out what your movie is an why the hell you are going to spill blood over it.</p>
<p>'Writing a treatment' or not is a question to ask for each project as it comes up , why say that you always need to or not, this is just a straightjacket. We all probably need to do it (and pitches etc) because there are several ways that a story needs to be told for it to sell according to who the audience is at that moment (a producer, a pitch comp, a director, a signed actor).</p>

<p>But how you unearth, shape and mould your story... you need to completely claim that bit for yourself. This is part of the long (glorious) journey of being a writer, finding out whether you keep it all in your head, whether you are better with a strict schedule, at night, is your writing better when you are healthy, sad, broke, desperate and so on.</p>

## Depends on the project type too

<p>My experience is that the process is very different depending on movie type; I have written treatments longer than the script and sometimes I just have very large pieces of paper with dense writing over them which I guess is an outline. For plays I might have a one or two page step outline and deep character notes and pictures, but then again sometimes I just go back through my journals, pick out scenes and notes and jump in to something halfway through and trust the rest will follow.

Sometimes writing the f**king thing is the only way to find out what the problems are, sometimes going back to cards is what you need. The only thing that I have found is consistent is putting together a playlist for the piece to listen to as I write and a couple of key images poised over the monitor.</p>
<p>This is the blood and guts of it, the rest is just a bunch of techniques that you can learn and apply when you feel that they are necessary to the moment.</p>
<p>What a great activity writing is :-)</p>
