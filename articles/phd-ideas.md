title: Digital and PhD ideas from over the years
masthead:

year: 2022

As I have been working full time in digital I don’t get a great deal of time to realise full digital projects - but I still have plenty of ideas!

So for the record here are some of my digitally-oriented ideas I have had over the years which haven’t progressed much beyond a text file. In my head they are fully realised and rather fabulous. In the real world a practice-based PhD is probably the way to achieve these - and I have had a number of ideas for these too.

It's not possible to have too many ideas, but it is possible for them to drive you slightly crazy… Ideas are cheap, realisation of ideas is where it's at.

All the people are us - 1998 - Pitch

In 98' 99' another writer and I pitch what would now be called a Transmedia project to the ABC. Centred around a bunch of friends living above a dept store in central Melbourne the threat of eviction forms the catalyst for all manner of trouble. The project was to centre around fictional characters and the narrative was to roll out in chat rooms and by text messaging with a radio play element; using a framework narrative, actors versed in improvisation and the incorporation of what now gets called UGC (user generated content) into active story lines. A great idea, not sure if it was actually technically possible at the time.

Johnson's London - 2009 - illustrated concept

This was an AR project I pitched to the Wellcome Trust. AR was pretty new at the time and phone were just about capable of doing this one. Basically a series of micro experiences that you had to be in the location itself to experience. It was specifically about the plague and Jonson’s Plague Year journal overlaid with the Wellcome Trusts collection items where possible. Rather than a strict tour this was to be dramatic in the sense that you had to collect items to survive, a bit like Zombie Run crossed with a London Plague Tour.

Three words - 2015 - working prototype

The digital product three words assigns three random words to any location on earth down to a few square metres. Using an API you can query a position and return some words. Using processing I created a proof of concept that allowed me to enter a location and create a small poem based on that location. Using a word net lookup I was also able to incorporate synonyms of those three words as well. The next stage of development was to then take a journey (via a GPS file) and create a longer piece out of it. The tech was relatively easy (I was teaching myself Processing at the time) the harder thing is, of course, making random words into structures that are both interesting and meaningful. I concluded that this was pretty much impossible and that, like many many digital artists before, the creation from meaning from the random flotsam of internet services had to be more about the ‘glitch’ than anything else. 

A short roster of PhD ideas

 ## Time 

The nature of time and how it relates to Drama. First of all a survey that relates the dramatic use of time to the dominant paradigm of time around. It’s relatively easy to map French classical theatre with Newtonian time and Postdramatic theatre with contemporary non linear time. What I was thinking of here was the pedagogy that related to that relationship; how you teach 3/5 act formats embodies a certain understanding of the universe as does devising work that is not conceived in linear time (networked performance). I was thinking of writing a series of plays that showed this relationship, or something longer that fully explored what contemporary theories of time imply for dramatic work. The emphasis would be on writing practice not performance making.

 ## Writing Machines 

I spend a lot of my time using content management and digital marketing systems. I often say that CMSs are just story telling machines like books and people look at me very strangely. What strikes me is the huge amount of money and time spent developing adaptive systems that respond in real time to various ‘intention’ factors in users journeys mostly just to make more money out of them (dynamic pricing and so on). 

Using those technologies to create story platforms and organisation systems is an interesting challenge; beyond using something like Twine how could you use ‘big iron’ Experience Platforms like Experience Manager and Sitecore to deliver custom stories and how would that play out?

I am thinking of simple to complex systems. Simple ideas like; Geo location to present different entry points to a story based on the hemisphere you live in. More complex like using Facebook pixel or Marketing networks to have stories follow you around the internet in the way bad ads. 

Conceptually this would draw the users attention towards the use of those technologies and so there would be a meta-critical aspect to this.

One version of thePhD is to create something this way, the other version is to examine current tech and methods to see how it could be done. This one would require the approval of one or more companies that might not like the meta-critical element.


 ## poeMix - 2020

Having discovered the world of digital audio production I have recently been attending virtual live code musical events. Using tools like Tidal, Hydra, Pd and so on coders join in physical or virtual spaces to create live music by keyboard. It’s a very welcoming and enjoyable community to witness. It’s a light years away from the tedious world of making a hit.

With a similar idea of escaping the grind of publication and making writing you know, fun, I thought about doing something similar for Poets: Shared work via simple web platform where multiple writers can write to a theme in real time, respond to other’s words in real time and so on. Virtual poetry jams, festival events, projected live work… all possible and relatively trivial to build for someone who had a grounding in a technology like React (I don’t). While the Tech would be a piece of cake the success of such a project would be the backing of an influential body or two.

It’s pretty much inconceivable that this platform doesn’t already exist somewhere. The inclusion element would be amazing - writing poetry *with* famous writers for schools - brilliant. Watching multiple people write and then join streams of words would be (a little) like watching multiple players playing a COGO tournament on Twitch.

The PhD would be the whole project - tech, engagement, events. Almost like a cultural engagement and innovation PhD. But I suspect this has been done already somewhere.
