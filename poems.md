## Poetry

So this is an empty page.

Blame the publishing world and the urge of online and offline publications to have exclusives.

Basically if you want to enter a poem in a competition or have it considered for publication you can't put it online and make it available as this counts as prior publication.

I get it but also it goes against the principle of the internet as a whole and the idea of free and open publication in particular.

And perhaps I shouldn't care and just put stuff up here anyway.

But then I still have some lingering ambition around my writing and have yet to give up dreams of publication, so, for the time being, this is a poetry page without any poetry.

However I do write quite a lot of it and I do intend to privately circulate some poetry soon. Sending an email with a poem in it is ok apparently as that is private correspondence.

## Manhire

Oh, wait, I have had one poem published and it had not much to do with me.

As an upstart 17 year old I did the infamous Creative Writing course at Victoria University with Bill Manhire. I got an A which meant quite a lot a the time, being so young. But then I lost confidence and, while still doing a lot of writing, never had the confidence to try to get anything published.

Never the less Bill pulled together a book of his favourites called Mutes and Earthquakes way back in 1997 and one of mine made the cut. I am in very good company in that book. I think I can include it here as fair usage:



And you can even [still buy the book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mutes-earthquakes-Manhires-creative-Victoria/dp/0864733186)
